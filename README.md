<!--  About me -->

<h3 align="left">Hello world!</h3>
<p align="left" >
I'm Hector Freard, an enthusiastic student of Computer Science at UPV, driven by a passion for software development and technology.
  
My GitHub serves as a platform to display the range of projects I've worked on during my years as a coder.

My main goal is to continue my learning in the scope of computer science, as well as personal projects to further develop my overall IT skills, meaning I am open to collaborate with fellow developers and actively contribute to open-source projects, since <i><b>'Teamwork is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results.</i></b>'

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any inquiries or suggestions.
</p>
